# MS1_CyberSecWarriors
In it's first version, this was a 3 page introduction to Cheri Southam's CV and proof of work during 2020 called MS1_Resume_Project.  
On 11/06/2020 it was changed to its current purpose.  This was partly due to too much emotional interest in the project making it harder for me to simplify 
descions and get on with the build and partly as I am volunteering as a leader for a 13-18 year old free education scheme teaching cyber security.
This is for the first milestone project (after study of HTML5 and CSS3) while completing a diploma in fullstack development.

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages] (#) and the Repository is on [GitHub] (https://github.com/CheriGore/MS1_resume_project.git).

## UX
USERS
For the purpose of showcasing HTML and CSS abilities a website is the best media.  Over time, more pages and parts can be added to present new skills learned.

USER STORIES
The main purposes of use will be:
- Club members and parents who can be directed to basic information, the learning games and required contacts.
- Other interested parties that might want to become club members and their parents.
- Other interested students of coding who may peruse the pages and study the source code for comparison or further learning.
- Other interested students of cyber security that might want to know about the scheme.
- Peers with similar skills that may be directed to these pages to help test and advise on their suitability and function.
- Testers with varying skills that can advise of UX and personal preferences.

DESIGN
All pages will include a static navigation panel at the top and a static panel footer with media links and webmaster details.
The first page (index) will welcome the students, list the governing bodies most recent news items provide the first look at 
the static sections.
The second page (info) will give information about the scheme.
The third page (contact) will list all the parties involved and their contact details.

The overall look shall be a neon cyber/dystopian/technology style. 
There will be rounded, slanted edges and slightly neon shine and colouring.  
Color scheme consists of:
background #020a3a
font color, H1, H2, H3 blue #46cbd8
font color hover blue 2 #05d9e8
font color pink #ff2a6d
font color hover pink 2 #e8598a
font color white #ffffff

Opaque backgrounds #ac3585
Additional buttons #7465f6

Font type Headers - Iceberg, Bold, Italic
Font type Paragraphs - Electrolize, Normal

### Example
-The following Wireframe was created in [WireframePro] (https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/CyberSecWarriors)

-The following Mockup was created in ????????.


These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in 
any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Future development could see more useful items suh as:
Direct access to the learning games
A scoreboard or Table
Automated news upload
More social media integration such as video chat, discord group or a Twitch account.

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [HTML5](https://HTML5.com)
    - The project uses **HTML5** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [CSS3](https://CSS3.com)
    - The project uses **CSS3** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [WireframePro](https://mockflow.com/)
    - The project uses **WireframePro** to prepare the project for build.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
